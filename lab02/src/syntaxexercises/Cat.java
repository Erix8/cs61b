 * Exercise 1: Class Creation.
 *
 * Translate the Python class below into Java by filling in this file.
 * You'll need to declare the fields, fill in the constructor, and
 * implement the two methods. Assume weight is an int.
 *
 *     class Cat:
 *         def __init__(self, name, weight):
 *             self.name = name
 *             self.weight = weight
 *
 *         def is_heavier_than(self, other):
 *             return self.weight > other.weight
 *
 *         @staticmethod
 *         def total_weight(c1, c2):
 *             return c1.weight + c2.weight
 *
 *     c1 = Cat("Mochi", 12)
 *     c2 = Cat("Tofu", 9)
 *     print(c1.is_heavier_than(c2))    # True
 *     print(Cat.total_weight(c1, c2))  # 21
